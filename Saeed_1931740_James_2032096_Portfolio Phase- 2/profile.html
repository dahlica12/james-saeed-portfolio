		<h3><strong>My Interest & Hobbies</strong></h3>

			<dt><b>Reading</b></dt>
				<dd>I like reading books, mostly fiction, when I have free time, especially during summer. Recently, I've gotten into reading more Stephen King, who predominantly writes the horror genre. One of my favorite books is "I'll Give You the Sun" by Jandy Nelson.</dd>
			<br><dt><b>Music</b></dt>
				<dd>Music is one of my favorite passtimes. I frequently listen to it, my favorite genres being: pop, alternative rock, indie, and show tunes. I recently purchased a guitar that I try to practice with every now and then.</dd>
			<br><dt><b>Writing</b></dt>
				<dd>Writing is a hobby that I don't get to practice as often as I want. I like brainstorming ideas and forming them into various stories. A dream of mine is to one day write a book.</dd> 
			<br><dt><b>Sports</b></dt>
				<dd>I may no longer be in any sports teams, but I enjoy playing sports with my family members, including basketball, soccer, and swimming. If I had a chance, I would join a volleyball team.</dd>
			<br><dt><b>Languages</b></dt>
				<dd>I love to learn new languages and hope to know more than two new languages during my lifetime. I used to study Greek, then Spanish, but have not practiced lately. I've recently started to learn basic Japanese from a friend.</dd>
